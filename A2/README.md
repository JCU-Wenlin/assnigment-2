## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
More than two weeks. It is very difficult, a lot of knowledge in the classroom is not enough, while doing while learning, early in advance, but not enough time. 

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I am satisfied with test. Because of the basic generalization in the class, the test class took a long timeã€‚
## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
Kivy and Classes. Classes need long time to creat, especially I need to change original file a lot. About Kivy it is difficult, the class only teach the simple function, it is not enough. 

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
I have not seen my marks so I cannot say what is well done. I think it's the basic part. 
## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
The first, GUI part. I have seen that more kivy introduction on official website, so it can make GUI have more function. Second, notice more detail in requirement, classes have more details need to add.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
Class records, powerpoint and some Chinese programming book. Trying to use them in my homework, I can ask teacher or friends When I do not understand.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
Kivy and Classes. Try more times and ask friends.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
I changed my original file, make classes for calling place py. and placecollection py. It can apply more function to system, and if there are bugs here,it is easy to change code.
